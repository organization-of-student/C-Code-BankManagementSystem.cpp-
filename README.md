# C-Code-BankManagementSystem.cpp-
This C++ program simulates a simple Bank Management System using object-oriented programming. It allows users to perform basic banking operations such as:

Creating new accounts

Viewing account details

Depositing and withdrawing money

Deleting accounts

Viewing all accounts

It uses a class-based structure (BankAccount) to represent individual bank accounts. In the simplified version, account data is stored in memory using a fixed-size array, supporting up to 10 accounts.
